# Project Overview


## Project Scope
What I am planning on building is a project planner for developers, it will be called Frontkick-Starter (name pending). What you will be able to do is create a project, where you can write out a full project description and proposal, upload wireframes/designs, write out your MVP/PMVP’s, and save/delete projects. I will be using Ruby on Rails for the backend, React for the front end, as well as various additional React animation libraries. I believe I can implement all of my MVP features within the allotted time period, but my main goal will be to get to my Post MVP which will dramatically change the function of the page. The Post MVP will make it so that users can create projects or designs that they would like to make, and that user can then assign different “roles” that need to be filled in order to complete the project. Once those roles have been filled, users are able to collaborate and create projects together that newer developers will be able to add to their portfolios.

### MVP/PostMVP
#### MVP
- Create/Delete an Account with Login/Logout functionality
- Create/Delete/Edit a project
  - Upload wireframes
   - Write out MVP, PostMVP deliverables
   - Estimated Timeline
   - General Description
   - Edit info
   - Trello board

#### PostMVP
- Full screen animation when someone "completes" something in their trello board
- Users will be able to post their projects, and create “roles” that need to be filled in order for the project to be completed. To start the Post MVP, there will only be two roles: developer, and designer. There can only be one designer per project, but as many developers as the project creator sees fit. 
- The projects never had actual financial return, however the project creator can assign percentages of a return should the project creator choose to pursue the idea commercially. A “contract” of some sort is created, and users can use an e-sign feature to electronically sign the contract.
